Game Synopsis: "The Orphans of Victorian London"

In a grim yet whimsical alternate Victorian-era London, a mysterious phenomenon has emerged, giving the orphaned children of the city extraordinary powers. These orphans, born into lives of hardship, now possess unique abilities tied to their past struggles, dreams, and fears. As a mysterious figure known only as "The Collector," players embark on a journey to capture these orphaned souls, discovering their deep, often tragic backstories, and harnessing their powers for an uncertain future.

Gameplay Overview:

Players traverse the sprawling, fog-filled streets of Victorian London, encountering a variety of orphans scattered throughout the city’s districts, each embodying different aspects of the era—poverty, oppression, and social unrest. Like a twisted version of Pokémon, players must use a combination of wit, empathy, and strategy to "capture" these children, not in the traditional sense, but through a bond forged by understanding their pains, desires, and fears.

The orphans’ abilities are shaped by their pasts. Some may have abilities like manipulating shadows, while others can summon memories or dreams. These powers are not only useful in battle but also essential for solving complex puzzles and overcoming obstacles within the game’s world.
